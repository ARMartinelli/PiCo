-- RUN STREAM ON PLAIN TAGGED OPTIONS

eg: ./run_stream.sh testdata/tagged_options_10M.txt
runs stock_pricing_stream. The input stream is read from the first argument and sent through a socket initialized by nc. It executes once for each number of worker with a fixed batch size (512)

eg: ./run_stockpricing_multi.sh testdata/tagged_options_10M.txt
runs stock_pricing_stream. Same as run_stream but run the experiments 20 times for each worker.

-- RUN BATCH ON PLAIN TAGGED OPTIONS


eg: run_stockpricingbatch_suite.sh  testdata/tagged_options_10M.txt
Runs stock_pricing reading data from the first argument. It executes once for each number of workers by changing the batch size.

eg: ./run_stock_tweets.sh <workers> <batchsize>
launch the stream generator and pipe it to netcat and then launches the streaming pipeline.
Input stock file and output are hardcoded in the script.
